### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## TODOS:
- Configure prettier code format rules
- Frozen brush effect on header: responsive to type, and also a music visualiser: clipped to header (possibly to scrolling document, make entry transparent, and solid on mouseover)
- Sticky search box
- 'Glint' effect on entry mouse over: to reveal music preview in TrackAndType component
- 'Go to collection' button beneath album art
- Load more, concat arrays instead of objects, see if it appends correctly
